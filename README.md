# Calculator
A simple calculator made with Java

---Calculator---


As the name indicates, this Java program is a simple and intuitive calculator. It has a main window and two menus with some information about the program itself and it's use. I made this program for practice purposes. I also added two features: a percentage button and a remainder button (%).

A .JAR file is included in the project folder. It was made with JDK 18.
